# DataMart-creation-for-a-Bank-for-Customer-Classification
Using Python, The goal of this project is to create a datamart for a Bank based on different datasets containing customer information. The Data Analysis was done in Python and the data visualization in the report was carried in Tableau
The bank wants to improve their services. For instance, the bank managers have only vague idea, who is
a good client (whom to offer some additional services) and who is a bad client (whom to watch carefully
to minimize the bank loses). Fortunately, the bank stores data about their clients, the accounts
(transactions within several months), the loans already granted, the credit cards issued. The bank
managers hope to improve their understanding of customers and seek specific actions to improve
services. A mere application of a discovery tool will not be convincing for them.;
